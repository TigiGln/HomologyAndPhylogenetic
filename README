DESCRIPTION:
This program is used to create cluster of homologous proteins and make a phylogenetic tree with this cluster.

It use 4 other programs:
1- diamond v2.0.4.142 (C) Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (witch is an alternative faster than Ncbi blast)
2- MUSCLE v3.8.31 by Robert C. Edgar
3- GBLOCKS 0.91b
4- PhyML version 3.1 (PhyML 20120412)

The executable of this program are in the directory 'subpart'

and the followinf libraries:
1- Tkinter
2- Biopython (SeqIO and Phylo)
3- sys
4- PIL
5- webbrowser
6- os
7- collections (defaultdict)
8- matplotlib
9- plotnine
10- time
 
There is five step in this program:
1- The creation of the diamonds database 
2- The bidirectionnal blast
3- The creation of clusters
4- The alignment with muscle
5- The curation with Gblocks
6- The creation of the tree with phyml

DEPENDENCY:

Except the libraries python (tkinter, biopython and matplotlib) you don't need to install anything for this program to work.
